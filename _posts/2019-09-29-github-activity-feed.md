## A Communication Powerhouse

![Activity Feed Overview](/assets/images/posts/github-activity-feed-overview.png)

Github is a social platform built for developers to share and collaborate on their code. You are probably familiar with interacting with Github at a code level. You know how to clone and push to repositories hosted on Github. That is excellent, but there is more to Github than slinging code, and the Activity Feed is your primary tool to stay current with everything happening on the site.   

### Follow Judiciously
There are some incredibly talented and smart people contributing to open source projects on Github. All of that code is publically available for you to research, learn from, and even contribute to. You need to know how to find projects interesting to you, and how to engage in those communities constructively. Once you know those two things, your ability to learn and talk about code is going to skyrocket.  The key to making the most out of Github is to keep the noise level down low enough that what is actually important to you is easily recognizable and actionable.

Finding people to follow on Github is not the challenge you will face. Finding people who are interesting to you who you want to actively engage with can be a bit harder. You want to actively protect is what kind of notices show up in your activity feed. When you get the right notices in there, your feed is a powerful tool to keep you informed about what is happing on Github. When the signal vs. noise ratio goes down the power of your activity feed is reduced.  If you’ve ever been frustrated on other social media sites over the lack of control of what winds up in your feed, then you are going to be pleasantly satisfied with the control you have on Github.  

### An example activity feed:

![Activity Feed Example](/assets/images/posts/github-activity-feed-example.png)

This is my personal feed which is actively curated to keep the signal to noise ration really, really high.  I use my Activity stream to watch student activity in the classroom and periodically check for things that I need to take action on.  Notices in there that I don’t need to take action on wastes my time and brainpower when I have to actively scan over and ignore them.  A perfect Activity stream would contain only notices that I want to click through and engage with.  I’m still working on getting it to that level, however.

## Who and What to follow
There are two strategies to keep your Activity stream under control, and you’ll likely do both of them regularly:  Be choosy, and cull often.

### Be Choosy
Firstly, you want to be choosy about what you add to your stream.  You can follow people and be notified of their activity, and you can follow projects to find out when they are active.  When you follow a user, you don’t have any more decisions to make.  When you watch a repository, you can choose the volume of notifications that land in your feed, ranging from only when you are mentioned all the way to any and all activity.

## Cull Often
Your interests evolve over time, and you don’t always know what you are signing up for when you follow a person or repo, so it pays to actively cull the list of happenings on Github vying for your attention.  If a project gets super chatty all of a sudden, and the interest to you is low,  unfollow them.  At some point in the future, if the project really is interesting, it will land in front of you again, and you can refollow. 

No one will know that you unfollowed, so you’re not going to hurt anyone’s feelings as you keep your Activity Stream relevant to you.  Go ahead and unwatch things, it only ups the relevance of the things that you still do-follow.

## What about Stars

You can star Github repositories from the project’s homepage, and also right from your activity feed.  Why do we want to though?  Great question, and now that we’re aggressively limiting the amount of content in the Activity stream, we have a great use for stars.  We can use them to keep track of interesting repositories that we want to keep an eye on but don’t necessarily need play-by-play updates on activity there. Stars are your bookmarks on Github.

## Github On The Go 

Github exposes your activity feed on a secure API, which is great news if you want to see what is happening on your feed when you are not working directly inside of Github.  
### Mobile Apps

There are a few mobile applications that provide access to your Activity Feed from your phone or Ipad.  I personally use Githawk.  Here’s a list of apps you can find in the iOS App Store.  Android will be similar.
* GitHawk
* CodeHub
* DevHub
* CoderX - costs $1.99

## Slack Integration

You can also pipe your Activity Feed over to your Slack account, and keep track of everything going on right from within Slack if you spend a lot of time there.  Just search for ‘Slack’ from the Marketplace page, and you’ll come across https://github.com/marketplace/slack-github among others.

## Summary
We looked at some of the powerful social tools available on Github to help us stay in touch and informed about what is happening with the people and coding projects that are important to us.  The key to making the most of the Activity Feed is to actively curate what shows up there.  You want the highest signal to noise ratio possible, making it fast and easy to scan the feed, and interesting to do so.  Fortunately, Github provides us good control over what goes into the feed.  

Third-party apps can also be useful to keep up with what is going on in your activity feed.  You can find apps on your phone, and even pipe notices from Github over to Slack and other chat apps.

Making the most of your Activity Feed on Github is going to help you stay more engaged and connected to what is happing in the technology community.
